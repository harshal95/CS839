<person>Clay Birdwell</person> is certainly unlucky in love. One lover's husband commits suicide in a way implicating <person>Clay</person>, and another lover gets shot while having sex with <person>Clay</person>. And those are only a few of the dead bodies that show up in director <person>David Dobkin's</person> little film noir called CLAY PIGEONS.
Written by <person>Matthew L. Healy</person>, the offbeat story follows a standard but satisfying formula of the serial killer who is being hunted by a dogged FBI agent. The movie is set in a sleepy, little western town. The sheriff's deputy, for example, is aptly named <person>Barney</person>. Like </person>Barney Fife</person>, he is a walking disaster, that is, when he isn't sleeping on the job.
<person>Joaquin Phoenix</person>, known as <person>Leaf Phoenix</person> when he acted in PARENTHOOD, plays <person>Clay</person>. Bringing little to the role, <person>Joaquin's</person> deadpan acting style is used by the director as the background canvas upon which to sketch the story.
As the always-horny wife <person>Amanda</person>, whose husband kills himself in the story's opening, <person>Georgina Cates</person> gives a convincing portrayal of a deceitful and sleazy blonde without an excess of brainpower.
<person>Vince Vaughn</person> steals the show as the handsome but conceited stranger named <person>Lester Long</person>. The happy-go-lucky <person>Lester</person> oozes so much charm that women almost drool over him. "I'm like a big fireworks show," he declares with his usual big smile and slightly nervous, hearty laughter. "I'm very bright." <person>Lester</person> takes <person>Clay</person> fishing but the only thing they catch is a dead body that happens to float by rather inopportunely.
The film's producer, <person>Scott Wilson</person>, plays <person>Sheriff Mooney</person>. He's a friendly sort who likes <person>Clay</person> and isn't much on detective work. Luckily for him and the audience, <person>Janeane Garofalo</person> shows up about midway through the picture and immediately enlivens it. She plays a supporting part as a veteran FBI agent on the trail of a serial killer.
Although there is not a lot to recommend the film, there isn't anything much to criticize either. It is an enjoyable enough little movie, and <person>Garofalo</person> is always fun to watch.
CLAY PIGEONS runs about 1:45. It is rated R for violence, sex, nudity and profanity and would be fine for older teenagers.
