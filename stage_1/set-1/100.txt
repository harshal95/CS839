HUSH, the latest in the tradition of the mad mother movies, feels like a hundred other films you've seen before. Only the delightful acting by <person>Gwyneth Paltrow</person>, as the daughter-in-law, breathes any life into it. <person>Jessica Lange</person>, as mother-in-law <person>Martha  Baring</person>, plays the same role of the fidgety woman that she's played so often. The twist is that this time her restlessness is the hint that her sweetness isn't genuine.
Opening with the hazy close-up of a child's toy merry-go-round as it plays "Hush little baby, don't you cry," the movie immediately telegraphs where it is going. With images of the creepy old <person>Bette Davis</person> movie HUSH... HUSH, SWEET CHARLOTTE firmly planted in their minds, the audience meets young lovers <person>Helen</person> (<person>Paltrow</person>) and <person>Jackson  Baring</person>, played as unbelievably naive by an unemotional <person>Johnathon Schaech</person>. <person>Helen</person> has all of the intelligence that <person>Jackson</person> lacks, and Paltrow acts rings around Schaech.
<person>Helen</person> is the first woman <person>Jackson</person> has ever brought home to visit his mother -- one in a long series of clues that makes the film so obvious that every "twist" becomes completely predictable. When <person>Helen</person> sees the Mount Vernon-sized mansion and massive grounds of the family estate, <person>Jackson</person> attempts to argue its commonness. "It's a farm," he tells her nonchalantly. "There's a mortgage. It's no big deal."
His constantly smiling and utterly agreeable mother welcomes them with open arms. Even when she walks in on them starting to have sexual intercourse in the hall -- not something most young adults would do in such a situation -- she smiles and walks away, trying not to disturb them.
As is patently obvious, all is not right at the family farm. <person>Soon Helen</person> becomes mysteriously pregnant, so she and <person>Jackson</person> decide to marry. (The pregnancy may be a mystery to <person>Jackson</person> and <person>Helen</person>, but not to the audience.) After they decide to marry, events then encourage them to move in with <person>Martha</person>. <person>Martha</person> quickly poisons their relationship with <person>Helen</person> seeing what is happening but <person>Jackson</person> remaining as blind as the proverbial bat to every obvious, sinister turn of events.
The script by <person>Michael Cristofer</person> and the director, <person>Jonathan Darby</person>, serves up many incredulities. One of the show's harder to believe claims is that <person>Martha</person> keeps her huge house immaculate without the aid of servants. That she would have trouble keeping help is plausible, but her doing all of the housework isn't. <person>Helen</person> falls asleep without make-up after having her baby but wakes up with fresh lipstick and makeup. Finally watch how <person>Helen's</person> very prominent pregnancy waxes and wanes like the moon, with one scene in particular showing her losing a half dozen inches off her waist and regaining them in the next.
