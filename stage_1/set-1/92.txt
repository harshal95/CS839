<person>Rachel Clifford</person> once had a husband, but now she's got a lover instead. She and her husband split up recently after she found out that he was having an affair. So she has taken up with a man named <person>Philip  Chaney</person>, who broke up with his ex-wife after he found out that she was having an affair.
This little soap opera of affairs on top of affairs is even more complicated because of <person>Rachel</person> and <person>Philip's</person> current situations. She is a part-time dentist at a male prison in Britain, where <person>Philip</person> is a prisoner. Soon after he comes to her with grinding-teeth syndrome, they begin to get the hots for each other. Since <person>Philip</person> is on a program where he can leave the prison one day a week to go to college, there are more opportunities than just the dental chair to become intimate with each other. (They manage clandestinely to fondle each other so much in the chair that viewers may come to think of the dental office in an entirely different way.)
<person>Julie Ormond</person> plays <person>Rachel</person>, and <person>Tim Roth</person> is <person>Philip</person> in the 1994 movie CAPTIVES. <person>Ormond</person> has gotten few good roles to display her talents other than SABRINA. <person>Roth</person>, on the other hand, plays basically the same evil character, and quite well, in most of his films (HOODLUM, PULP FICTION, ROB ROY), but the best is his self-parody role in the Woody Allen musical EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU.
As <person>Rachel</person> and <person>Philip</person> begin an improbable romance, and she literally lets her hair down when she comes through the visitor's rather than the staff entrance to see him one visiting day.
Their trysting spot is a women's restroom at a bus stop, where they engage in passionate and intense, but not particularly graphic, sex. Soon <person>Rachel</person> doesn't just like <person>Philip</person>, she is sending him erotic tapes to listen to in the comfort of his prison cell.
Given his long lack of female companionship, the fact that <person>Philip</person> falls for someone as beautiful as <person>Rachel</person> is completely believable, but that she would fall for the crude looking and acting <person>Philip</person> is pretty hard to buy. Badly miscast, <person>Roth</person> is convincing as a prisoner but not as an irresistible lover.
In the film's least believable aspect, she's willing to risk her job and his upcoming release to have sex with him in public places, but she doesn't feel that she knows him well enough to be able to ask him why he was sent to prison in the first place. Sure. It's halfway through the story before she finally gets up the courage to find out what he did, and by then you can probably guess his crime.
Another hard to fathom part is the way <person>Rachel</person> leaves all of the sharp instruments of her trade in plain view so that the prisoners could easily steal them.
Not nearly creepy enough and only sporadically romantic, the film drifts along in fits and spurts. CAPTIVES's director <person>Angela Pope</person> is much better in her subsequent film, the devastating HOLLOW REED.
