Tired of overhyped shows with big budget stars? Want to see an old fashion grade B sci-fi flick? Well, I have just what you are looking for, THE ARRIVAL. Within the parameters of this genre, THE ARRIVAL is a fun and surprisingly good film. It is funny without ever lapsing into self-parody. Even the hokey plot somehow evolves into something bordering on plausibility if you just turn your brain off and go with the flow.
In the opening, that I worried would be an omen for the audience, scientist <person>Ilana Green</person> (<person>Lindsay Crouse</person>) looks out on a green field of wildflowers in the Arctic and proclaims a single sentence, "Shouldn't be here." It turns out that I was glad I was at this show, but in the next scene when I saw nerdy <person>Charlie Sheen</person> as radio astronomer <person>Zane  Ziminski</person>, I began to worry again. <person>Zane</person> has classic bad glasses, a goatee from the 60s, and a burr haircut to boot. A highly overdrawn character to say the least.
<person>Zane</person> works at a Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) facility. One night he finally hears something out in space communicating back to earth. When he plays the 42 second tape to his boss at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, <person>Phil Gordian</person> (<person>Ron Silver</person>), <person>Zane</person> does not get the response he expects. <person>Gordian</person> tells him, "searching for ETs in this political environment is a tough sell." He then goes on to explain how <person>Zane</person> is being downsized out of his job effective immediately. <person>Zane</person> is nonplused calling his find, "the premier scientific discovery of the twentieth century."
As in most B movies, there are a couple of unnecessary romantic subplots. <person>Zane</person> can not understand his beautiful wife and successful stock broker Cher (<person>Teri Polo</person>). Looking at her he remarks, "Boolean logic I trust. Algorithms I trust. Beautiful women are beyond me."
Soon the mysterious holes in the atmosphere that <person>Ilana Green</person> is investigating and the communication from outer space that <person>Zane  Ziminski</person> (love that name) is digging into, become linked in a massive problem for the entire planet. Along the way, the script mixes in a lot of natural comedy, both in words and in action. <person>Zane</person> threatens <person>Gordian</person> with, "What do I want to do? I want to blow a hole in your head and donate your organs to science, but I've got a few questions first." Later <person>Gordian</person> warns, "If you can't tend to your own planet, you don't deserve to live here." The funniest scene in the show is the bathtub one, which will have you in stitches. The show is also inventive, a good example of this being how <person>Zane</person> extricates himself when trapped underground.
