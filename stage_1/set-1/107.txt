I saw JOHNS at the press screening. It opens Friday, January 31. It will be playing at one of the Camera Cinemas in the San Jose area and at the Lumiere Cinemas in San Francisco.JOHNS A film review by <person>Steve Rhodes</person> Copyright 1997 <person>Steve Rhodes</person>
RATING (0"I am not a prostitute," says young prostitute <person>Donner</person>, played with naivete and sensitivity by <person>Lukas Haas</person> (WITNESS). "I am an entertainer. I do not go in for violence." Life on the street is tough and weird. Today's "date" is an eighty-year-old pervert who gets off by spanking boys.
JOHNS is a frequently shocking, intensely real, and always poignant look at the lives of young hustlers. First time director and writer <person>Scott Silver</person> makes many of the mistakes of newcomers but, nevertheless, shows much promise with his troubling, touching, and sometimes humorous view of homeless kids.
<person>Silver's</person> background is as a documentarian, and it shows. In the press kit he says he got the idea during his first Christmas in Hollywood where the temperature was in the 90s, and "I felt utter desolation, despair, and depression." His approach to developing the story for the movie was to interview young hustlers, paying them $20 each to hear their stories. From these ideas, acknowledged in the credits, he derived the script.
JOHNS happens on the day before <person>Christmas</person>. <person>John</person>, played quite believably by <person>David Arquette</person> (SCREAM), is sleeping in the park when his expensive, lucky shoes and his money in them are stolen. The camera focuses in tight for close-ups as his long dirty feet go running in vain after the thief. <person>John</person> gets some golf shoes with cleats from his first trick of the day, <person>Danny Cohen</person>, played by <person>John  C. McGinley</person> (from THE ROCK). <person>John</person> clanks along with these golf shoes through the rest of the picture.
<person>Tomorrow</person> is <person>John's</person> 21st birthday, and he has long had plans to stay one night on vacation at the fancy Park Plaza Hotel. Now he is broke. But it gets worse. Because he took money during a drug deal gone bad, <person>Jimmy Warlock</person> (<person>Terence Dashon Howard</person>) is looking for him to collect the money -- one way or another.
<person>Donner</person> is <person>John's</person> happy-go-lucky friend. <person>Donner</person> has the innocence of someone new to the street. His parents disowned him because he was gay, and now he is picking up tricks to make ends meet. Although there are some similarities to MIDNIGHT COWBOY, <person>John</person> and <person>Donner</person> are much more clean-cut looking.
Although I did laugh a few times, mainly I felt sorry for these two kids. The best parts of the show are the musical interludes where they go about their everyday business while some dreamy tune is playing. The songs have all the happiness that the prostitutes lack.
The supporting cast is strong, except for <person>Alanna Ubach</person> (from the delightful DENISE CALLS UP) who plays <person>John's</person> girlfriend. <person>Ubach's</person> performance is unbelievably strident.
Arguably the best performance is by an actor in the minuscule role of hotel registration desk clerk <person>Paul  Truman</person>. <person>Richard Kind</person> takes what has all of the markings of being the most cliched part in the film and gives <person>Paul</person> great warmth and compassion. I cannot say more or I would give away some of the most precious moments in the film, and poor <person>John</person> needs his few good times to preserve his dignity.
Much is wrong and infuriating with JOHNS. The cinematography has an intentional low budget look in the constant outdoor scenes. The background is so overexposed that you feel like you will be blinded. Although the film has a good narrative drive, it is too predictable. The ending seems obvious from the start. Nevertheless, the characters are sympathetically drawn so that every time their predictable tragedies arise, they touch your heart.
