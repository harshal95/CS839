SET IT OFF is a warmed over THELMA AND LOUISE story full of cliched racial stereotypes. The whites discriminate and oppress while the blacks drink heavily, smoke dope, and rob banks. Both groups are highly proficient in killing each other.
<person>Takashi Bufford</person> and Kate Lanier's manipulative script tries to make you care for the hard working members from the projects, but it overstates its case so badly that it loses most of its credibility. SET IT OFF is a high energy show featuring lots of automatic weapons and flying bullets. The action rarely lags, and you need only wait short intervals before another scene will do something to try to shock you.
<person>Frankie</person> (Vivica Fox from INDEPENDENCE DAY) is a recently promoted teller at a bank. As the show opens, her cheery day takes a turn for the worse when <person>Darnell</person>, an acquaintance from the projects, comes to her station. She tells him that she is surprised he has enough money to have a bank account.
<person>Darnell</person> and his friends are there to rob the bank. The heist goes bad and people on both sides have their blood splatter all over each other. After the hailstorm of bullets subside, <person>Darnell</person> and company make their exit.
<person>Darnell</person> runs square into rule number one when robbing banks. If you rob a bank, do not have initials carved into your hairdo. Cops like hints like that. Remember, those little video cameras aren't there for nothing.
"What's the proper procedure for dealing with this situation?" asks <person>Detective Strode</person> (<person>John C. McGinley</person>) about what <person>Frankie</person> should have done in the stickup. Blood splattered <person>Frankie</person> does not pass this kangaroo court in her boss's office after the robbery so he fires her on the spot. This is one of many contrived and unbelievable sequences. Never does she think about complaining about her rights or threatening to sue.
<person>Frankie</person> takes a night job as a janitor along with her friends, a tough lesbian named Cleo (<person>Queen Latifah</person>), a single mom named <person> Tisean</person> (<person>Kimberly Elise</person>), and a woman named Stony (Jada Pinkett from THE NUTTY PROFESSOR) who has a kid brother having problems getting into UCLA. The women work in a huge and lavish office building full of chrome and glass which is the exact opposite of the environment where they live. They pick up the photos on the desks and ridicule the workers there as having it so much easier that they do. One woman in the picture, for example, they say clearly doesn't wash any dishes.
