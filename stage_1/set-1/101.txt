Shakespeare has become a hot author of late in Hollywood. He is pushing out <person>Jane Austin</person> and <person>Henry James</person> as the dead author of choice. Director and writer <person>Trevor Nunn's</person> (HEDDA and LADY JANE) TWELFTH NIGHT proves my thesis that even a mediocre film adaptation of one of the Bard's plays is well worth savoring.
<person>Trevor Nunn's</person> LADY JANE was a touching piece of filmmaking, but his TWELFTH NIGHT is fairly inaccessible due to the by-the-numbers acting of most of the principals. The adaptation of the text is quite literal, but the passion and the chemistry is not up to par.
According to the film's press kit, TWELFTH NIGHT is "the most popular of all of Shakespeare's comedies." As far as plays go, I don't think I agree, but when it comes to films, I know that <person>Kenneth Branagh's</person> MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING is much better than <person>Nunn's</person> TWELFTH NIGHT.
TWELFTH NIGHT also suffers in comparison to <person>Baz Luhrmann's</person> recent ROMEO AND JULIET which he transformed into an extremely high energy and audacious comedy. TWELFTH NIGHT seems lifeless in comparison. Granted TWELFTH NIGHT is a much more traditional rendition, but ROMEO AND JULIET is much more involving and fun even if it is a romantic tragedy recast into a comedic farce.
TWELFTH NIGHT is a typical Shakespearean comedy full of ambiguities and errors about identities and intentions. Nothing is quite what it seems to be, but the audience is in on the tricks and mistakes. The script is full of subtleties and complexities that the actors have to flesh out.
The show starts with a shipwreck off the coast of Illyria where twins <person>Viola</person> (<person>Imogen</person> Stubbs from SENSE AND SENSIBILITY and A SUMMER STORY) and <person>Sebastian</person> (<person>Stephen Mackintosh</person>) both think the other has perished. They not only look alike; they even make their living as actors where <person>Viola</person> dresses up as a male complete with a false mustache just like Sebastian's. Although she looks like a woman trying to look like a man, it is enough to entertain the passengers.
"If music be the food of love, play on," says <person>Duke Orsino</person> of Illyria (<person>Toby Stephens</person>) as <person>Viola</person>, now called <person>Cesario</person>, plays in drag. <person>Orsino</person> enlists <person>Cesario</person> to court Countess <person>Olivia</person> (<person>Helena Bonham Carter</person> from HOWARDS END and LADY JANE) on his behalf, but it is not that simple as <person>Olivia</person> ends up falling for <person>Cesario</person> and <person>Cesario</person> for <person>Orsino</person>.
The most interesting and outlandish acting is done by <person>Nigel Hawthorne</person> (THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE) as <person>Malvolio</person>. <person>Malvolio</person> is tricked into believing that <person>Olivia</person> is in love with him and that all he needs to do is wear bright yellow stockings and smile incessantly to signify his love for her. <person>Olivia</person> is not in on the joke and is bemused by his sudden change in behavior.
"I am not what I am," confesses <person>Cesario</person> to <person>Olivia</person>. Later she tells <person>Orsino</person>, "I am all the daughters of my father's house and the brothers too." The film subtlety examines the characters' bisexuality. Most of this is done in knowing looks and quick kisses and is one of few times the movie really comes alive.
"Why, this is very midsummer's madness," claims <person>Olivia</person>. The problem with the picture is that it isn't. Other than <person>Hawthorne's</person> performance, it is very tame.
The ending is the best part of the play. As <person>Olivia</person> says, it is "most wonderful."
Technically the film is more successful. The cinematography by <person>Clive Tickner</person> radiates golden autumnal colors. <person>Shaun Davey's</person> music is majestic as would befit a much more substantial and serious movie. My favorite little touch is the hats created by <person>John Bright</person> for the soldiers. They wear what can only described as an elevated mortar board on their heads. I laughed every time I saw them.
