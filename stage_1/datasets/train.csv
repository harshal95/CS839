MURIEL'S,0
WEDDING,0
is,0
an,0
Australian,0
film,0
that,0
tries,0
to,0
be,0
both,0
a,0
comedy,0
and,0
a,0
tragedy,0
Most,0
shows,0
that,0
attempt,0
this,0
fail,0
miserably,0
because,0
they,0
keep,0
pulling,0
their,0
punches,0
and,0
can,0
not,0
decide,0
what,0
they,0
want,0
to,0
be,0
Muriel's,0
Wedding,0
on,0
the,0
other,0
hand,0
is,0
a,0
success,0
at,0
both,0
I,0
laughed,0
out,0
loud,0
at,0
the,0
funny,0
parts,0
and,0
I,0
got,0
upset,0
and,0
concerned,0
at,0
the,0
serious,0
This,0
is,0
the,0
classic,0
ugly,0
duckling,0
fable,0
retold,0
for,0
our,0
generation,0
and,0
given,0
a,0
different,0
and,0
imaginative,0
development,0
So,0
often,0
in,0
this,0
show,0
you,0
would,0
think,0
you,0
can,0
predict,0
it,0
and,0
it,0
surprises,0
you,0
Our,0
ugly,0
duckling,0
is,0
Muriel,0
Heslop,0
from,0
Porpoise,0
Spit,0
Australia,0
The,0
names,0
alert,0
the,0
viewer,0
from,0
the,0
beginning,0
that,0
this,0
is,0
a,0
scriptwriter,0
who,0
is,0
willing,0
to,0
go,0
out,0
on,0
a,0
limb,0
with,0
his,0
material,0
In,0
fact,0
the,0
script,0
by,0
P,0
J,0
Hogan,0
who,0
also,0
directed,0
the,0
movie,0
is,0
the,0
second,0
best,0
part,0
of,0
the,0
show,0
There,0
is,0
great,0
dialog,0
through,0
out,0
the,0
show,0
One,0
of,0
my,0
favorites,0
is,0
when,0
Muriel's,1
"""friends""",0
tell,0
her,0
to,0
get,0
lost,0
since,0
they,0
can,0
not,0
be,0
seen,0
with,0
her,0
Muriel,1
explains,0
that,0
"""I",0
know,0
I,0
am,0
not,0
normal,0
but,0
I,0
am,0
working,0
on,0
it,0
I,0
can,0
change,0
I,0
can,0
I,0
"can.""",0
The,0
unprintable,0
sexual,0
banter,0
and,0
joking,0
among,0
the,0
young,0
women,0
I,0
found,0
absolutely,0
hilarious,0
The,0
best,0
part,0
of,0
the,0
movie,0
has,0
to,0
be,0
the,0
incredible,0
performance,0
of,0
Toni,0
Collette,0
as,0
the,0
large,0
boned,0
fairly,0
homely,0
socially,0
inept,0
and,0
not,0
too,0
bright,0
Muriel,1
Muriel,1
had,0
a,0
singular,0
desire,0
in,0
life,0
and,0
that,0
was,0
to,0
get,0
married,0
since,0
nobody,0
thought,0
she,0
could,0
In,0
fact,0
the,0
movie,0
opens,0
with,0
her,0
getting,0
the,0
wedding,0
bouquet,0
in,0
the,0
traditional,0
toss,0
Her,0
friends,0
demand,0
she,0
give,0
it,0
back,0
since,0
she,0
has,0
no,0
chance,0
of,0
finding,0
anyone,0
to,0
marry,0
her,0
and,0
hence,0
she,0
should,0
throw,0
it,0
to,0
one,0
of,0
them,0
Solid,0
logic,0
in,0
their,0
book,0
I,0
found,0
Collette's,1
version,0
of,0
simple-mindedness,0
more,0
convincing,0
than,0
that,0
of,0
Tom,0
Hanks,0
as,0
Forrest,0
Gump,0
Gump,0
was,0
cartoon,0
character,0
heroic,0
Muriel,1
is,0
more,0
like,0
somebody,0
you,0
knew,0
in,0
High,0
School,0
and,0
either,0
ignored,0
or,0
felt,0
sorry,0
for,0
You,0
may,0
find,0
yourself,0
hunting,0
up,0
all,0
of,0
those,0
old,0
wallflowers,0
at,0
the,0
next,0
High,0
School,0
reunion,0
and,0
trying,0
to,0
get,0
to,0
know,0
them,0
for,0
the,0
first,0
time,0
This,0
show,0
really,0
makes,0
you,0
think,0
about,0
life,0
and,0
about,0
how,0
shy,0
and,0
ostensibly,0
ugly,0
people,0
are,0
treated,0
Some,0
of,0
my,0
favorite,0
scenes,0
of,0
her,0
were,0
when,0
she,0
got,0
so,0
happy,0
she,0
started,0
laughing,0
uncontrollably,0
as,0
in,0
her,0
first,0
romantic,0
encounter,0
Her,0
happiness,0
was,0
infectious,0
I,0
felt,0
instantly,0
giddy,0
Muriel,1
had,0
such,0
a,0
great,0
way,0
of,0
expressing,0
herself,0
She,0
said,0
that,0
when,0
she,0
was,0
lonely,0
she,0
used,0
to,0
stay,0
in,0
her,0
room,0
all,0
day,0
long,0
listening,0
to,0
ABBA,0
music,0
and,0
now,0
that,0
she,0
was,0
happy,0
she,0
felt,0
that,0
her,0
life,0
was,0
an,0
ABBA,0
song,0
The,0
interesting,0
parts,0
of,0
the,0
show,0
do,0
not,0
stop,0
here,0
The,0
whole,0
Heslop,0
family,0
is,0
highly,0
dysfunctional,0
Most,0
appear,0
to,0
have,0
low,0
IQs,0
all,0
are,0
overweight,0
and,0
they,0
are,0
all,0
lazy,0
with,0
the,0
exception,0
of,0
Dad,0
who,0
treats,0
his,0
whole,0
family,0
like,0
dirt,0
He,0
is,0
a,0
local,0
politician,0
and,0
wheeler-dealer,0
who,0
worries,0
that,0
his,0
family,0
is,0
a,0
curse,0
on,0
his,0
career,0
Dad,0
is,0
played,0
by,0
Bill,0
Hunter,0
who,0
was,0
also,0
good,0
in,0
STRICTLY,0
BALLROOM--which,0
is,0
definitely,0
worth,0
seeking,0
out,0
in,0
the,0
dusty,0
corner,0
of,0
your,0
local,0
video,0
store,0
Her,0
mother,0
Jeannie,0
Drynan,0
is,0
so,0
out,0
of,0
it,0
she,0
spends,0
time,0
staring,0
at,0
the,0
cup,0
with,0
the,0
tea,0
bag,0
in,0
it,0
going,0
round,0
and,0
round,0
in,0
the,0
microwave,0
Although,0
their,0
roles,0
were,0
all,0
one,0
dimensional,0
I,0
loved,0
the,0
performances,0
by,0
the,0
actresses,0
who,0
played,0
the,0
ditsy,0
young,0
women,0
Muriel,1
hung,0
around,0
with,0
in,0
the,0
first,0
of,0
the,0
movie,0
Their,0
pancake,0
makeup,0
with,0
the,0
glossy,0
light,0
colored,0
lipstick,0
and,0
the,0
1970s,0
hairdos,0
really,0
said,0
it,0
all,0
These,0
women,0
thought,0
they,0
were,0
still,0
the,0
hot,0
stuff,0
they,0
were,0
in,0
high,0
school,0
They,0
made,0
fun,0
of,0
Muriel,1
because,0
she,0
listened,0
to,0
70s,0
music,0
when,0
they,0
were,0
more,0
out,0
of,0
touch,0
than,0
she,0
was,0
I,0
have,0
no,0
criticisms,0
of,0
the,0
movie,0
For,0
what,0
it,0
tried,0
to,0
be,0
I,0
think,0
it,0
hit,0
the,0
nail,0
on,0
the,0
head,0
Although,0
we,0
are,0
not,0
talking,0
about,0
comedy,0
on,0
the,0

BEST,0
I,0
loved,0
the,0
choice,0
of,0
names,0
Juliet,1
was,0
easy,0
to,0
fall,0
in,0
love,0
with,0
and,0
Hugo,1
was,0
easy,0
to,0
figure,0
might,0
get,0
into,0
trouble,0
To,0
be,0
fair,0
about,0
names,0
I,0
should,0
point,0
out,0
that,0
there,0
was,0
only,0
one,0
king,0
of,0
England,0
with,0
my,0
name,0
Steven,1
and,0
that,0
he,0
was,0
arguably,0
the,0
worse,0
of,0
the,0
lot,0
This,0
movie,0
is,0
fascinating,0
and,0
has,0
a,0
whole,0
series,0
of,0
great,0
plot,0
set,0
ups,0
The,0
filming,0
is,0
imaginative,0
and,0
takes,0
many,0
risks,0
The,0
actors,0
and,0
actress,0
are,0
good,0
with,0
the,0
exception,0
of,0
McGregor,1
who,0
does,0
Alex,1
as,0
the,0
standard,0
obnoxious,0
character,0
you,0
have,0
seen,0
done,0
many,0
times,0
before,0
I,0
thought,0
Fox,1
gave,0
the,0
most,0
intriguing,0
and,0
fully,0
developed,0
performance--I,0
look,0
forward,0
to,0
seeing,0
her,0
in,0
more,0
movies,0
in,0
the,0
future,0
The,0
small,0
part,0
of,0
Hugo,1
was,0
the,0
briefest,0
but,0
perhaps,0
the,0
best,0
There,0
is,0
a,0
lot,0
good,0
about,0
this,0
show,0
and,0
yet,0
it,0
is,0
seriously,0
underdeveloped,0
The,0
characters,0
start,0
off,0
fine,0
but,0
then,0
are,0
not,0
given,0
any,0
memorable,0
lines,0
Many,0
times,0
the,0
writer,0
will,0
create,0
a,0
scene,0
quite,0
well,0
and,0
then,0
do,0
nothing,0
much,0
with,0
it,0
If,0
they,0
had,0
written,0
a,0
much,0
stronger,0
role,0
for,0
the,0
police,0
it,0
would,0
have,0
added,0
to,0
the,0
tension,0
and,0
the,0
drama,0
greatly,0
but,0
the,0
police,0
characters,0
were,0
just,0
grafted,0
onto,0
the,0
plot,0
The,0
movie,0
seemed,0
too,0
concerned,0
with,0
style,0
over,0
character,0
development,0
The,0
director,0
Danny,0
Boyle,0
clearly,0
wants,0
to,0
be,0
the,0
Hitchcock,0
of,0
the,0
90s,0
but,0
he,0
gets,0
quickly,0
lost,0
We,0
end,0
up,0
with,0
a,0
Hitchcock-lite,0
tale,0
that,0
has,0
gratuitous,0
violence,0
a,0
la,0
Steven,0
King,0
or,0
any,0
slasher,0
movie,0
pasted,0
on,0
in,0
place,0
of,0
a,0
viable,0
script,0
The,0
good,0
news,0
is,0
that,0
the,0
violence,0
is,0
contained,0
to,0
a,0
relatively,0
few,0
number,0
of,0
scenes,0
The,0
bad,0
news,0
is,0
that,0
one,0
of,0
them,0
seems,0
to,0
go,0
on,0
forever,0
The,0
movie,0
runs,0
about,0
1:37,0
but,0
for,0
the,0
small,0
amount,0
of,0
material,0
they,0
had,0
it,0
needed,0
to,0
be,0
10-15,0
minutes,0
shorter,0
It,0
is,0
correctly,0
rated,0
R,0
for,0
scenes,0
of,0
extreme,0
violence,0
that,0
has,0
the,0
audience,0
gasping,0
aloud,0
"""Oh",0
my,0
"God""",0
and,0
for,0
a,0
little,0
bit,0
of,0
nudity,0
I,0
found,0
that,0
even,0
I,0
had,0
to,0
look,0
away,0
after,0
a,0
while,0
during,0
the,0
long,0
violent,0
scene,0
I,0
don't,0
think,0
this,0
show,0
is,0
appropriate,0
for,0
teenagers,0
I,0
liked,0
many,0
parts,0

the,0

I,0
gave,0
it,0

OUTBREAK,0
is,0
a,0
detective,0
story,0
and,0
a,0
thriller,0
about,0
a,0

IN,0
THE,0
LINE,0
OF,0
FIRE,0
fame,0
This,0
is,0
a,0
director,0
who,0
knows,0
how,0
to,0
create,0
great,0
tension,0
that,0
really,0
grabs,0
the,0
audience's,0
attention,0
and,0
holds,0
it,0
through,0
out,0
the,0
entire,0
movie,0
He,0
is,0
also,0
a,0
master,0
at,0
action,0
sequences,0
and,0
the,0
military,0
helicopter,0
scenes,0
in,0
this,0
flick,0
were,0
evidence,0
of,0
his,0
abilities,0
as,0
well,0
as,0
that,0
of,0
the,0
cinematographer,0
OUTBREAK,0
starts,0
in,0
a,0
remote,0
village,0
in,0
Zaire,0
From,0
the,0
very,0
beginning,0
of,0
the,0
show,0
we,0
know,0
that,0
there,0
is,0
a,0
virus,0
of,0
cataclysmic,0
proportions,0
It,0
works,0
so,0
fast,0
that,0
if,0
you,0
are,0
not,0
dead,0
in,0
twenty-four,0
hours,0
after,0
being,0
exposed,0
you,0
are,0
safe,0
This,0
germ,0
detective,0
story,0
is,0
excellent,0
and,0
the,0
pacing,0
is,0
good,0
so,0
that,0
your,0
eyes,0
stay,0
glued,0
to,0
the,0
screen,0
Go,0
to,0
the,0
bathroom,0
before,0
entering,0
you,0
don't,0
want,0
to,0
miss,0
any,0
of,0
the,0
details,0
It,0
is,0
complex,0
and,0
yet,0
quite,0
easy,0
to,0
follow,0
The,0
germ,0
detective,0
work,0
had,0
much,0
the,0
flavor,0
of,0
the,0
movie,0
AND,0
THE,0

OUTBREAK,0
at,0
its,0
best,0
was,0
almost,0
as,0
good,0
Petersen,0
is,0
a,0
master,0
director,0
After,0
seeing,0
this,0
movie,0
I,0
should,0
warn,0
you,0
that,0
you,0
may,0
never,0
want,0
to,0
fly,0
in,0
airplanes,0
again,0
You,0
certainly,0
will,0
find,0
yourself,0
leaving,0
any,0
theater,0
where,0
someone,0
coughs,0
Sad,0
to,0
say,0
we,0
also,0
learn,0
from,0
the,0
beginning,0
that,0
there,0
is,0
a,0
subplot,0
in,0
the,0
show,0
that,0
is,0
going,0
to,0
have,0
us,0
believe,0
that,0
our,0
military,0
has,0
some,0
covert,0
operations,0
of,0
massively,0
evil,0
proportions,0
going,0
on,0
Without,0
this,0
ridiculous,0
and,0
unnecessary,0
sojourn,0
into,0
again,0
lambasting,0
our,0
own,0
generals,0
the,0
movie,0
had,0
a,0
perfectly,0
plausible,0
ring,0
to,0
it,0
The,0
acting,0
was,0
uneven,0
Dustin,0
Hoffman,0
whom,0
I,0
have,0
not,0
seen,0
in,0
many,0
movies,0
recently,0
stars,0
as,0
the,0
military,0
chief,0
of,0
biological,0
research,0
His,0
research,0
was,0
on,0
finding,0
the,0
causes,0
of,0
and,0
curing,0
viral,0
infections--not,0
on,0
developing,0
killer,0
germs,0
Hoffman,1
delivers,0
star,0
quality,0
work,0
He,0
is,0
totally,0
believable,0
and,0
never,0
goes,0
overboard,0
with,0
his,0
acing,0
which,0
he,0
has,0
been,0
known,0
to,0
do,0
in,0
other,0
films,0
Also,0
excellent,0
in,0
the,0
show,0
was,0
Hoffman's,1
sidekick,0
played,0
by,0
Cuba,0
Gooding,0
Jr,0
He,0
played,0
the,0
aggressive,0
green,0
recruit,0
character,0
in,0
fresh,0
and,0
interesting,0
ways,0
He,0
enliven,0
every,0
scene,0
he,0
was,0
in,0
Rene,0
Russo,0
who,0
was,0
so,0
excellent,0
in,0
Petersen's,0
last,0
show,0
IN,0
THE,0
LINE,0
OF,0
FIRE,0
was,0
given,0
a,0
poorly,0
written,0
part,0
as,0
Hoffman's,1
domestic,0
counterpart--the,0
head,0
of,0
germ,0
research,0
at,0
the,0
CDC,0
She,0
was,0
also,0
his,0
ex-wife,0
Believably,0
having,0
an,0
ex-wife,0
as,0
beautiful,0
as,0
Russo,1
Hoffman,1
spent,0
most,0
of,0
the,0
movie,0
trying,0
to,0
get,0
her,0
back,0
Russo's,1
acting,0
was,0
not,0
credible,0
and,0
moreover,0
I,0
would,0
just,0
as,0
soon,0
have,0
seen,0
her,0
whole,0
part,0
eliminated,0
The,0
germ,0
research,0
had,0
the,0
energy,0
to,0
stand,0
on,0
its,0
own,0
and,0
did,0
not,0
need,0
a,0
romantic,0
second,0
subplot,0
to,0
add,0
excitement,0
to,0
the,0
movie,0
Another,0
tragedy,0
of,0
the,0
film,0
was,0
the,0
wasting,0
of,0
Morgan,0
Freeman,0
as,0
Hoffman's,0
commanding,0
general,0
This,0
was,0
the,0
weakest,0
character,0
Freeman,1
has,0
ever,0
been,0
asked,0
to,0
play--very,0
one,0
dimensional,0
This,0
brilliant,0
actor,0
GLORY,0
DRIVING,0
MISS,0
DAISY,0
THE,0
SHAWSHANK,0
REDEMPTION,0
etc,0
did,0
not,0
seem,0
to,0
care,0
about,0
the,0
show,0
and,0
gave,0
a,0
pedestrian,0
performance,0
Finally,0
the,0
less,0
said,0
about,0
Donald,0
Sutherland's,0
part,0
as,0
the,0
Major,0
General,0
who,0
was,0
Freeman's,1
boss,0
the,0
better,0
Both,0
characters,0
were,0
cliches,0
that,0
should,0
not,0
have,0
been,0

is,0
a,0
movie,0
with,0
a,0
strange,0
name,0
and,0
a,0
bizarre,0
twist,0
on,0
an,0
old,0
theme,0
Anthony,0

who,0
was,0
great,0
as,0

in,0

a,0
quick,0
contract,0
from,0
Peter,0
Boyle,0
to,0
kill,0
Mimi,0

The,0
twist,0
is,0
that,0
Rogers,1
knows,0
this,0
and,0
is,0
waiting,0
for,0
LaPaglia,1
to,0
show,0
up,0
at,0
her,0
place,0
to,0
kill,0
her,0
The,0
mystery,0
is,0
why,0
is,0
she,0
being,0
killed,0
and,0
is,0
she,0
actually,0
in,0
favor,0
of,0
it,0
or,0
not,0
The,0
script,0
is,0
good,0
and,0
provides,0
several,0
large,0
laughs,0
One,0
of,0
my,0

scenes,0
involves,0
LaPaglia's,1
incompetent,0
sidekick,0
played,0
by,0
Matt,0
Craven,0
Craven,1
explains,0
that,0
the,0
reason,0
he,0
seems,0
afraid,0
of,0
his,0
own,0
shadow,0
is,0
that,0
he,0
has,0
a,0

He,0
pops,0
these,0
little,0
Magnesium,0

and,0

in,0
the,0

The,0
acting,0
was,0
good,0
all,0
around,0
except,0
I,0
did,0
not,0
like,0
the,0
character,0
played,0
by,0
Craven,1
--he,0
got,0
on,0
my,0

have,0
seen,0

sometime,0
SOMEONE,0
TO,0
WATCH,0

ME,0
or,0
THE,0
RAPTURE,0
but,0
she,0
was,0
pretty,0
good,0
here,0
She,0
certainly,0
is,0
one,0
beautiful,0
forty-year-old,0

I,0
can,0

from,0
the,0

This,0
movie,0
is,0
a,0
two-person,0

study,0
and,0
either,0
that,0
works,0
for,0
you,0
or,0
it,0
doesn't,0
For,0
me,0
I,0
liked,0
some,0
of,0
the,0
banter,0
of,0
the,0
dialog,0
but,0
kept,0
feeling,0
left,0
empty,0
The,0
show,0
never,0
offends,0
has,0
some,0
quite,0
good,0
moments,0
but,0
it,0
just,0
did,0
not,0
work,0
for,0
me,0
If,0
you,0

the,0
main,0
reason,0
to,0

The,0
principal,0
of,0
a,0
French,0
boarding,0
school,0
for,0
rowdy,0
boys,0
is,0
played,0
by,0
Paul,0
Meurisse,0
His,0
Spanish,0
wife,0
is,0
played,0
by,0
Vera,0
Clouzot,0
and,0
his,0

The,0

He,0
beats,0

the,0
two,0

moreover,0
they,0
both,0

than,0
the,0
fun,0
script,0
and,0
all,0
of,0
the,0

plays,0
convincing,0
you,0
of,0
one,0
"""fact""",0
only,0
to,0
start,0
making,0
you,0
think,0
that,0
just,0
the,0
opposite,0
is,0
true,0
the,0
only,0
other,0
outstanding,0
part,0
of,0
the,0
movie,0
is,0
the,0
cinematography,0
It,0
transports,0
you,0
to,0
France,0
and,0
to,0
a,0
time,0
past,0
The,0
feel,0
of,0
the,0
countryside,0
and,0
of,0
the,0
little,0
private,0
school,0
is,0
at,0
once,0
both,0
hokey,0
and,0
wonderfully,0
evocative,0
of,0
a,0
simpler,0
era,0
Watch,0
especially,0
how,0
the,0
camera,0
will,0
stop,0
and,0
pause,0
on,0
small,0
features,0
like,0
the,0
dead,0
leaves,0
floating,0
on,0
top,0
of,0
the,0
swimming,0
pool,0
The,0
film,0
maker,0
is,0
careful,0
to,0
focus,0
in,0
menacingly,0
on,0
the,0
expressions,0
on,0
the,0
characters,0
faces,0
when,0
they,0
are,0
surprised,0
or,0
frighten--very,0
Hitchcockean,0
The,0
problem,0
I,0
had,0
with,0
the,0
film,0
and,0
the,0
reason,0
I,0
did,0
not,0
rate,0
it,0
higher,0
was,0
the,0
one,0
dimensional,0
acting,0
The,0
husband,0
was,0
supposed,0
to,0
be,0
the,0
canonical,0

but,0
I,0
did,0
not,0
buy,0
Meurisse,1
performance,0
for,0
a,0
minute,0
He,0
was,0
totally,0
unconvincing,0
Signoret,1
did,0
an,0
acceptable,0
job,0
of,0
portraying,0
a,0
character,0
who,0
showed,0
no,0
emotion,0
at,0
all,0
The,0
only,0
interesting,0
work,0
was,0
that,0
of,0
Vera,0
Clouzot,0
--wife,0
of,0
the,0
director,0
Henri-Georges,0
Clouzot,0
Her,0
performance,0
had,0
some,0
depth,0
but,0
still,0
she,0
was,0
mainly,0
a,0
stick,0
figure,0
Her,0
version,0
of,0
fear,0
reminded,0
me,0
of,0
a,0

The,0
movie,0
runs,0
about,0
two,0
hours,0
It,0
is,0
not,0
rated,0

probably,0
would,0
get,0
an,0

and,0
the,0
adult,0

There,0
is,0
no,0
sex,0
or,0

The,0
little,0

it,0
has,0
is,0
realistic,0
but,0
not,0
bloody,0
or,0

It,0
would,0
be,0
fine,0
for,0
any,0

to,0

I,0
