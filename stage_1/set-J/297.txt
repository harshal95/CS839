Movie Premise: <person>Kennedy</person> was killed because of Vietnam and almost every man, woman and child alive at the time was part of the conspiracy.
My short review: Sure.
My expanded review: <person>Oliver Stone</person> is a great movie director. Sometimes he lets his skill go to his head. This is a fine movie from a technical and an acting viewpoint. The problem is that it is all balderdash.
So I guess, I do recommend it, but why oh why can't he sprinkle in a little realism. I hate fantasies masquerading as reality.
