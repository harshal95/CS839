Sitting through the pathetically bad TRIAL AND ERROR, one's mind naturally fantasizes about the movie that could have been. In a film where little is salvageable, two of the actors, <person>Jeff Daniels</person> and <person>Charlize Theron</person>, develop characters that have potential, albeit almost all of it unrealized. Their romantic fling is the only glimmer of hope in an otherwise dismal movie. But their affair is so brief and inconsequential to the heart of this slapstick comedy that it does not come close to saving the picture.
<person>Charlize Theron</person>, who gave an excellent but small performance as Helga in 2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY, plays a waitress named <person>Billie</person>. <person>Billie</person> was an astronomer on her way to grad school at Berkeley when a tire blew out on her trailer in Nevada. She liked the desert terrain so much that she decided to live there in her stranded trailer and get a job in a nearby town. When she invites <person>Charlie Tuttle</person> (<person>Daniels</person>) to ditch his rich lifestyle and live with her in bliss in the middle of nowhere, it is easy to dream about the show that could have been because the chemistry between them is promising. But, this little piece of the movie is a mere sideshow.
You may remember <person>Daniels</person> from GETTYSBURG, which should have gotten him an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor, or from many other films. Hopefully, his fans will soon forget his part in this disaster.
In TRIAL AND ERROR, new law partner, and soon to be newlywed, <person>Charlie</person> goes to a courtroom in a tiny Nevada town to represent lifelong con artist <person>Benny Gibbs</person> (<person>Rip Torn</person>). <person>Benny</person> sells copper engravings of <person>Lincoln</person> through the mail. For $17.95, <person>Benny</person> mails his customers a shiny new penny.
<person>Charlie</person> gets drunk the night before the trial. Through a misadventure, his actor buddy <person>Richard Rietti</person> (<person>Michael Richards</person>) ends up impersonating him in court. Since they are never able to straighten this out, <person>Michael Richards</person> becomes lawyer <person>Charlie</person> and <person>Jeff Daniels</person> his assistant <person>Richard</person>. It is not as funny as it sounds.
<person>Jessica Steen</person> plays prosecutor <person>Elizabeth Gardner</person>, at whom <person>Richard</person> makes a crude pass at the bar the night before the trial. Typical of the unbelievable humor of the show, his come-on line to her at the bar has him talking about intercourse in the second sentence after saying hello.
Although director <person>Jonathan Lynn</person> has two good comedies to his name, MY COUSIN VINNY and SGT. BILKO, most of his films, such as CLUE and THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMEN, have not been very successful. To be honest, the blame for TRIAL AND ERROR should be shared with first-time writers <person>Gregory</person> and <person>Sara Bernstein</person>. They rely on unoriginal sight gags for much of the (non-existent) laughter. Characters fall through ceilings, people get food stuck on their mouths, lovers walk in accidentally on other lovers, actors fall over each other, guys sitting on the lawn get soaked by the sprinklers, and the canonical list of cheap movie humor goes on ad infinitum.
As I left the theater I reflected on the film, ULEE'S GOLD, that I had seen at a press screening earlier in the week. It has marvelous acting and a beautiful story, but with its low budget it will open at a few art house around the country and be seen by almost no one. TRIAL AND ERROR, on the other hand, will play at thousands of screens. It is sad that so many people will accept TRIAL AND ERROR's poor quality when films that deserve to be seen are ignored.
TRIAL AND ERROR runs 1:38. It is rated PG-13 for language. The film would be acceptable for kids say 10 and up. I recommend you avoid this unfunny comedy. I give it * for the valiant attempts by <person>Daniels</person> and <person>Theron</person> to rescue a sunken movie.
