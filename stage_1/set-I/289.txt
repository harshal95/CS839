This year New York City is hosting the annual NAFGA (North American Fairy Godmothers Association) convention, and, of course, every self-respecting fairy godmother wants to be there, including the lone male fairy godmother <person>Murray</person> (<person>Martin Short</person>) and one gone over to the dark side, a witch named <person>Claudia</person> (<person>Kathleen Turner</person>). For companionship, <person>Claudia</person> brings along her recently humanized dog Boots (<person>Amanda Plummer</person>).
It must have sounded promising to <person>Mara Wilson's</person> parents when her agent pitched her proposed part in A SIMPLE WISH. After <person>Mara's</person> success in a featured role in MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET followed by a starring role in MATILDA, she would get to work with two big name stars, <person>Kathleen Turner</person> and <person>Martin Short</person>, in a film with a promising plot.
Perhaps her parents should have studied the script by <person>Jeff Rothberg</person> (THE AMAZING PANDA ADVENTURE) to see if it contained more than some cute magic tricks - it doesn't.
Probably more apropos would have been for them to view director <person>Michael Ritchie's</person> collection of films including such forgettable ones as his last three, THE FANTASTICKS, COPS AND ROBBERSONS and THE SCOUT. <person>Ritchie</person> spends all of his creative energy in A SIMPLE WISH in clever staging of the wishes, and allocates no time for directing the acting. If <person>Turner</person> and <person>Short</person> have insulted their viewing public with more pathetic acting in other movies, the names of the films do not come to mind.
A SIMPLE WISH has one of the most inauspicious beginnings on record. <person>Murray</person>, looking extra weird with his large front teeth caps, is taking his fairy godmother qualifying exam. For five long and tedious minutes, <person>Short</person> demonstrates how to overact while doing slapstick.
We then switch to the Greening family. Single dad, aren't they all in the movies today, <person>Oliver</person> (<person>Robert Pastorelli</person>) drives a horse-drawn carriage around Central Park, but he wants to be a Broadway singer in the musical TWO CITIES. His son <person>Charlie</person> (<person>Francis Capra</person>) is the typical obnoxious movie teenager. His daughter <person>Anabel</person>, played sweetly by the gifted actress <person>Mara Wilson</person>, has a brand new and highly incompetent fairy godmother, <person>Murray</person>, to help her.
"One wish per customer and no wishes for more wishes," explains <person>Murray</person>. "They plugged that loophole up years ago. In past years there were abuses."
There are about a half dozen wishes in the show and <person>Murray</person> screws up most of the them. My favorite is when <person>Murray</person> transports <person>Anabel</person> and himself to the fleabag Plaza Motel in Nebraska instead of the luxurious Plaza Hotel in Manhattan. When the tobacco chewing redneck who owns the place draws a bead on them with a shotgun, <person>Murray</person> tries to turns him into a little rabbit. Ops, big mistake. An angry giant rabbi starts attacking them.
Prophetically, <person>Anabel</person> says at one point, "This stinks." To which <person>Murray</person> concurs, "I know, it's bad." And how.
A SIMPLE WISH runs 1:30. It is rated PG for perhaps a few bad words that I missed. The show would be acceptable for all ages. My son <person>Jeffrey</person>, age 8, thought the show was "excellent," and his buddy <person>Matthew</person>, age 8, said that the film "goes up there among my favorites." I found most of the film pathetic so I give it thumbs down. For the imaginative wishes and for poor <person>Mara Wilson's</person> nice performance in a terrible picture, I give it * 1/2.
