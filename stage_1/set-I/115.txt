I was really looking forward to this movie. I thought <person>Mel Gibson</person> could do a very interesting HAMLET, and he did.
The problem was with the direction. It was slow and plodding. I found it hard to stay awake in parts. Usually <person>Shakespeare</person> is so lively it is hard to keep up, but not this version.
Also, I was a bit surprised at how little any music was used. The other actors were okay except for <person>Allan Bates</person> who also seemed to sleep through his scenes.
Normally, I love <person>Franco Zeffirelli</person> and in fact one of my favorite movies is his ROMEO AND JULIET which has great intensity and interest in every scene.
I would HAMLET give it 2 stars and a thumbs down. I must in fairness point out that my wife really liked this movie. Then again, she would show if <person>Gibson</person> were reading the phone book.
