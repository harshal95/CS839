"My brother and I were born strangers." The bittersweet drama INVENTING THE ABBOTTS chronicles the coming of age of two brothers, <person>Doug</person> and <person>Jacey Holt</person>, played with touching sincerity by <person>Joaquin Phoenix</person> (TO DIE FOR) and <person>Billy Crudup</person> (SLEEPERS). Set in 1957 in Haley, Illinois, the show is reminiscent of several old movies, but the story remains fresh and relevant.
<person>Doug</person> has fewer social graces than his slightly older brother Jacey.<person>Doug</person> will try anything, including painting on fake sideburns, to impress the girls. <person>Jacey</person>, on the other hand, attracts female companionship like honey attracts flies. As much as they profess their differences, they are remarkably similar in looks and tastes.
The boys are bound together in a close knit family run by their grade school teaching mother, <person>Helen</person>. <person>Kathy Baker</person> plays the widow with a natural grace. Her husband died during a childish bit of bravado before <person>Doug</person> was born. <person>Baker's</person> minor, but crucial, role has its biggest impact in a small revelation scene at the dinner table.
Although the story centers on the boys, equally interesting are the girls who live in the town's mansion. <person>Jennifer Connelly</person> (MULHOLLAND FALLS) plays the middle sister <person>Eleanor Abbott</person>, <person>Liv Tyler</person> (THAT THING YOU DO) is her younger sister <person>Pamela</person>, and <person>Joanna Going</person> (WYATT EARP) is her older sister <person>Alice</person>.
<person>Jennifer Connelly</person> gives a strong performance as the sexually promiscuous sister. She unabashedly loves sex and views sleeping around to be as natural as eating. Her no-holds-barred role even includes one of the few comedic scenes in the show. As partially shown in the film's trailers, when <person>Doug</person> tries to look up her dress in the library, she has both an enticement and a surprise for him. <person>Connelly</person> steals her scenes in INVENTING THE ABBOTTS.
The older sister <person>Alice</person> has a child and is about to be divorced. <person>Alice</person> is trivially older than the others, but the extra two years means she is the only one that can buy the beer. <person>Alice's</person> role is small, and <person>Going's</person> acting diminishes rather than enhances its importance.
The story focuses more on <person>Pam</person> than on the other sisters. <person>Pam</person> looks and walks an ostrich. The costumes by <person>Aggie Guerard Rodgers</person> and the makeup, transform a normally radiant <person>Tyler</person> into a gawky teenager -- the mirror image of her looks in STEALING BEAUTY. Unlike her sexually active sisters, <person>Pam</person> wants to take it slow, real slow, when it comes to sex. She draws the line at kissing, which drives <person>Doug's</person> raging hormones wild. <person>Tyler's</person> acting is convincing during this part, but not later when <person>Pam</person> has supposedly matured some.
The Abbott family, like the Larrabee family in SABRINA, uses parties as a form of control. They throw them constantly as largess to buy off the town. The Abbotts are run with an iron glove by the father <person>Lloyd</person> (<person>Will Patton</person>). <person>Patton</person> (THE SPITFIRE GRILL) outlines his part but little more, happy to keep it pure formula. <person>Lloyd's</person> wife <person>Joan</person> (<person>Barbara Williams</person>) shows up but has nothing to do.
Screenwriter <person>Ken Hixon</person> creates a movie full of poignant and realistic vignettes. Typical of these is the simple scene of<person>Doug</person> and <person>Pam</person> horsing around on the family sofa. He wants to go upstairs and have sex with her, but she resists. They end up having non-sexual fun, just kidding around with each other. Their play comes to a halt when her big feet hit him in the groin.
The film's major difficulties stem from <person>Pat O'Connor's</person> direction. <person>O'Conner</person>, who gave us the delightful CIRCLE OF FRIENDS, seems incapable of weaving <person>Hixon's</person> vignettes into a compelling whole. The film drags frequently and the actors are allowed to let their voices taper off into incomprehensible, low mumbles. The film's pacing and energy level too often sag. The good parts are so insightful and strong that they easily carry the picture, but the interludes can be quite frustrating.
INVENTING THE ABBOTTS runs 1:50. It is rated R for sex, nudity, and some profanity. It would be fine for teenagers. The film's high points make the movie well worth recommending, but its droughts make me able to give it only ** 1/2.
