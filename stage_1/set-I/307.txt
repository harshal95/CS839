ANGEL BABY is an Australian film from 1995 that swept their equivalent of the Oscars and is just now being released in the United States. It tells a rarely told story about the plight of two mentally ill people who meet and fall in love. To preserve their new family they will make a decision that will put both of their lives in jeopardy.
<person>Harry</person> and <person>Kate</person> meet at a group therapy session at a psychiatric clinic referred to as "The Clubhouse." With their medications they are coping with life well enough so that they are outpatients rather than residents. Unlike the others in their circle they are both attractive and so love naturally enters the picture.
<person>Harry</person> is played with sincere and touching emotions by <person>John Lynch</person>. He is an excellent actor who has enriched many films including: CAL, THE SECRET GARDEN, IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER, THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH, and MOLL FLANDERS. This coming week I will get to see his work again at the press screening of SOME MOTHER'S SON.
<person>Kate</person> is played with beauty and grace by the lovely <person>Jacqueline McKenzie</person> (TRAPS). Although they both have severe emotional problems, hers is worse so <person>McKenzie's</person> part proves the more challenging. She is convincing as a troubled woman who has natural and intense yearnings for romance, and yes, for sex. Their sexual relationship is shown naturally and explicitly, but it is never sensationalized or exploited. Confined to an important middle segment in the show, the sexual escapade is the central thread that convinces the audience of the strength of the lovers' commitment.
First time director <person>Michael Rymer</person>, who also wrote the script, weaves a story full of inner truths and high energy. When <person>Kate</person> meets <person>Harry</person> for the first time, she rejects him out of hand with, "I don't hang around with psychos."
<person>Kate</person> has help in life. She believes that she is watched over by her guardian angel, <person>Astral</person>. Knowing that <person>Astral</person> is always there to guide her is what makes <person>Kate's</person> life bearable. The way <person>Astral</person> communicates is the most surprising aspect of ANGEL BABY. <person>Kate</person> listens to all "Wheel of Fortune" episodes and takes copious notes since <person>Astral</person> sends her messages through the game board. This is not done for comedic effect, but as a natural thing a mentally disturbed person might believe.
<person>Kate</person> has a hard getting through life. When she is invited to eat dinner at the home of <person>Harry's</person> brother <person>Morris</person> (<person>Colin Friels</person>) and his wife <person>Louise</person> (<person>Deborra-Lee Furness</person>), they serve her chicken. <person>Kate</person> keeps losing the chicken leg as she uses a soup spoon to get the meat off the bone.
Once <person>Harry</person> and <person>Kate</person> realize how much they love each other, they get an apartment together. Choosing the apartment proves a challenge. They insist on a good number, and the selection of available apartments is limited. Watching him get a job again as a programmer and her try to set up house is joyfully touching.
One big day she announces she is pregnant. How does she know asks <person>Harry</person>. Easy, the "Wheel of Fortune" answers for the day were: "Great Expectations" and "Big as a blimp." She should get tested, but she does not trust the doctor recommended by her psychiatrist. He asks her, "Would you prefer to see another doctor?" She retorts, "Yes, <person>Dr Seuss</person>."
<person>Harry</person> thinks the answer to their troubles and to their fear of birth defects because of their heavy medication lies in, "no more junk food, no more coffee, and no medications." For someone with their mental disorders, this is a recipe for death.
Up until this point the show had been touching and serious but upbeat. From the quotes and the situations you may think it is funny, but actually it is not. After they stop their medications, all hell breaks loose, but the director carefully keeps his actors in line. Most would have been content to let them overact so they could have complete artistic freedom.
By the end of the film, I was reduced to tears. This is a tragedy that is never manipulative and always genuine, and the heartfelt acting makes it a powerful movie.
ANGEL BABY runs 1:45. It is not rated but would get an R for the sex, nudity, and profanity. The film would be fine for serious and older teenagers. I recommend the movie to you and give it ***.
