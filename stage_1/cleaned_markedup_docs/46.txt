The fundamental requirement of a director is that his actors should never appear to be such. In SIMPATICO, based on a play by <person>Sam Shepard</person>, director <person>Matthew Warchus</person> is never able to turn his talented cast into anything approaching real characters. The movie has many an interesting vignette, but never do his actors become flesh-and-blood characters. Instead, the actors strut their stuff and show off their craft but nothing more.
Maybe it's because this play isn't suitable material for a motion picture, or maybe it's because <person>Warchus</person>, whose background is as a stage director, doesn't understand the needs of the cinema. Whatever the reason, SIMPATICO just limps tediously along until the ending credits put it out of its misery.
The story revolves around a decades-old horse racing scam. As a Dumpster Dan of an alcoholic, <person>Nick Nolte</person> plays a loser named <person>Vinnie</person>. <person>Vinnie</person> has the goods in the form of proof of the scam, which he uses to harass his old co-conspirators.
As the wealthy, cigar-chomping <person>Carter</person>, <person>Jeff Bridges</person> plays a Kentucky horse farm owner who's still scamming his way through life. <person>Sharon Stone</person> plays <person>Carter's</person> boozed up wife, <person>Rosie</person>.
<person>Catherine Keener</person>, who can playing working-class types better than just about anyone, is Cecilia, a Payless store clerk, who is <person>Vinnie's</person> girlfriend -- well, kind of. <person>Vinnie</person> is such a filthy, no-account that it's hard to see how anyone could tolerate him for more than a few moments. When pressed, she does admit to kissing him, but only once.
Completely wasted in the picture is <person>Albert Finney</person> as the race commissioner who long ago was set up by <person>Carter</person> and Company.
The only modest tension in the film involves <person>Carter's</person> sale of a soon-to-be-worthless race horse named <person>Simpatico</person>. Lacking any sustained momentum, the movie just ends. Just before the ending, the story interjects a completely predictable, but nevertheless ridiculous, little melodrama. It's the type of pseudo-tragedy that will leave you murmuring to yourself, "Oh, come on!".
