The sweetly silly MIRACLES (QIJI), stars <person>Jackie Chan</person> (RUSH HOUR and SHANGHAI NOON), who also serves as the film's writer and director. Originally released in 1989, a new, uncut and undubbed version is being shown in selected theaters now in the United States. With a handsome new print that shows off the picture's sumptuous and colorful sets and costumes, the movie manages to rise above its slapstick roots.
For those who go to <person>Chan</person> films only to see his signature brand of comic kung fu -- he prides himself in doing his stunts himself, no matter how painful -- the movie may be disappointing. Not until a long ending sequence set in a rope factory does <person>Chan</person> really allow himself to cut loose and show off. When he does, it is such a treat that even those who find the body of the story flagging will think it is worth the wait.
The plot has the always adorable <person>Chan</person>, as <person>Cheng Wah Kuo</person>, accidentally becoming the leader of a group of Hong Kong gangsters, who are never happier that when their Tommy guns are blazing. (The period isn't specified but appears to be the Roaring Twenties or perhaps just a bit later.) <person>Kuo</person> wants his gang to find more respectable ways to earn a living, so he starts a nightclub called the Ritz in which Luming Yang (<person>Anita Mui</person>) becomes the lead singer.
The least interesting subplot has <person>Kuo</person>'s rival, Tiger (<person>Chun Hiang Ko</person>), trying to extort half of the nightclub's earnings. The main story concerns <person>Kuo</person>'s big-hearted attempt to turn a flower woman, <person>Madam Kao</person> (Yah-Leh Gui), into a wealthy socialite for a short time in order to impress the family of the Shanghai man that her daughter, Belle (Gloria Yip), wants to marry. Lies beget more lies as <person>Kuo</person> tries his best to help <person>Madam Kao</person> impress her future son-in-law's parents so that they will give their permission for him to marry her daughter.
"I'm tired of this farce," <person>Kuo</person>'s right-hand man says at one point. And to be honest, so was I. A little trimming sometime could be a good thing. Still, even if it does drag a bit, <person>Chan</person>'s charm saves the day. It's a good-spirited production that's certain to leave a smile on your face.
MIRACLES runs 2:07. The film is in Cantonese with English subtitles. It is rated PG-13 for action violence and some language and would be acceptable for kids old enough to read subtitles.
My son <person>Jeffrey</person>, age 12, seeing his first subtitled film, gave it ** 1/2. He said that he liked it and that it was cool and funny. He found the subtitles -- it's a talky film -- a bit hard to keep up with at times.
