As you sit watching <person>Bonnie Hunt</person>'s adult fairy tale, RETURN TO ME, it's easy to convince yourself that this old-fashioned romance must be a remake of some 1940's movie. With its sweetly sappy scenes of love and courtship, it tells a delightful story that is a throwback to a simpler time at the cinema.
Then it hits you. This can't be remake of something that you saw decades ago because the kickoff point for the plot concerns a medical procedure (heart transplant) that hasn't been around very long.
<person>Bob  Rueland</person>'s (<person>David Duchovny</person>) wife, Elizabeth (<person>Joe ly Richardson</person>), dies in a car accident. She is a zoologist whose big ambition of building <person>Sydney</person> and her other apes a bigger habitat is finally about to come to fruition. After her death, <person>Bob</person> supervises the building of the habitat, but without Elizabeth he's terminally unhappy. His friends try, without much success, to fix him up with dates, including a disastrous one with a woman (<person>Holly Wortell</person>) who has a water obsession. She can only drink bottled water from certain countries.
Meanwhile, <person>Grace  Briggs</person> (Minnie <person>Driver</person>), who was near death, is saved by an anonymous heart transplant donor (Elizabeth). This is where the magic in the plot comes in. When <person>Bob</person> first lays eyes on <person>Grace</person>, both smile and feel like they've met before. Even <person>Sydney</person> recognizes <person>Grace</person>. <person>Hunt</person>, however, is wise enough to downplay these incidents. <person>Basically</person>, <person>Bob</person> and <person>Grace</person> just fall in love slowly and naturally, which isn't easy given how hard their respective friends are trying to match them up with everyone they know.
<person>Grace</person>'s best friend, <person>Megan</person> (<person>Bonnie Hunt</person>), and her husband, <person>Joe</person> (<person>James Belushi</person>), are always trying to arrange dates for <person>Grace</person>, who is extremely sensitive about the 10 inch scar on her chest from the operation. "I've already told him [<person>Grace</person>'s latest blind date] that she's had some work done," <person>Joe</person> tells <person>Megan</person>. "She's not a Buick!" <person>Megan</person> admonishes <person>Joe</person>.
Filmed on location, the movie is a valentine to Chicago. From the intimate scenes set in the Irish-Italian restaurant of <person>Grace</person>'s family to the sweeping skyscraper vistas, the city looks gorgeous and inviting.
A veritable senior citizen's home worth of older actors (<person>Carroll  O'Connor</person>, <person>Robert Loggia</person>, <person>Eddie Jones</person>, <person>William Bronder</person> and <person>Marianne Muellerleile</person>) support these the 30something leads, <person>Driver</person> and Duchovny. The chemistry between the lovers is genuine and never rushed. The parts of the script that challenge the PG rating are the intensity of the early tragedy. <person>Sex</person> isn't part of the storyline.
It isn't until the last act that <person>Grace</person> and <person>Bob</person> realize the heart connection. The result of the discovery is predictable, but who cares. This heart-warming movie (pun intended) is an unabashedly sentimental love story, not a mystery.
RETURN TO ME runs 1:53. It is rated PG for language and thematic elements and would be fine for kids around 10 and up.
My son <person>Jeffrey</person>, almost 11, liked all of the movie except for the initial tragedy. Giving it ***, he said that he found the movie hilarious and that he especially liked seeing <person>Carroll  O'Connor</person>.
