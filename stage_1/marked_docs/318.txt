Bittersweet comedies are tricky at best even under the most expert guidance. <person>Director Micheal Pressman</person>, who previously brought the world TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES II: THE SECRET OF OOZE, tries his hand at a weeper with the mawkish title TO <person>GILLIAN</person> ON HER 37TH BIRTHDAY and ends up with a mess.
This schmaltzy ode oscillates between comedy and tragedy, but only the comedy is successful. The script by <person>David  E. Kelley</person> based on <person>Michael Brady</person>'s play has characters in constant banter that puts the audience in stitches. As soon as they begin to enjoy the film, however, it switches back to its maudlin roots, and people just stare at the screen not knowing what to make of its false sentimentality.
The acting is equally uneven. Ever handsome <person>Peter Gallagher</person> is <person>David  Lewis</person>. Two years ago his wife <person>Gillian</person>, played by ever beautiful <person>Michelle Pfeiffer</person>, died in a foolish bit of bravado on their yacht while celebrating her 35th birthday. Now, normally strange <person>David</person>, is acting even stranger having long talks on the beach with his dead wife. Other than looks, neither actor brings anything to the part. Although <person>Pfeiffer</person> gives one of the most insubstantial pieces of acting in her career, <person>Gallagher</person>'s acting is not much meatier. The good news is that the strong supporting cast, who are given all the comedic lines, almost saves the film.
Every year on <person>Gillian</person>'s birthday, known to them as "<person>Gillian</person>'s Day", her sister <person>Esther  Wheeler</person> (<person>Kathy Bates</person>) and <person>Esther</person>'s husband <person>Paul</person> (<person>Bruce Altman</person>), come to <person>Nantucket Island</person> to share the day with <person>David</person>, <person>Gillian</person>, and their now 16 year old daughter <person>Rachel</person> (Claire Danes). Just because <person>Gillian</person> has become an apparition appearing only to <person>David</person> is no reason to cancel the festivities.
Exactly two years after <person>Gillian</person>'s death, the Wheelers make their annual pilgrimage to the <person>Lewis</person>'s isolated house on the island. This year they bring along a surprise blind date for <person>David</person>, a female named <person>Kevin  Danford</person> (<person>Wendy Crewson</person>). <person>David</person> is taken aback and tells <person>Paul</person>, "Don't you think it is a little insensitive fixing me up on her birthday?" <person>Paul</person> sternly retorts, "<person>Gillian</person> has no more birthdays."
<person>Rachel</person> is worried about her Dad, but <person>Esther</person> consoles her with, "He will be all right. It's just, he really loved her." Staying with <person>Rachel</person> is her girlfriend <person>Cindy  Bayles</person> (<person>Laurie Fortier</person>), and <person>Cindy</person> sets <person>Kevin</person> straight with, "He's not going to fall for you. Live people can't compete with dead ones."
Soon the seriousness passes for a bit, and we are into the fun silliness of <person>Gillian</person>'s Day. As is the tradition, they do wild and crazy things like break out the karaoke so they can sing old <person>Barry Manilow</person> songs. Most importantly, the day coincides with the island's yearly sandcastle building contest. <person>David</person> has a plan complete with elaborate blueprints to build a Gothic castle and unseat the reigning champion - a nine year old girl. These scenes are off the wall and very funny, but the laughter is all guarded because the audience knows that this film will switch without warning to its somber core.
Although thankfully not very often, <person>Pfeiffer</person> does show up in some scenes. When she does, she gets asinine little saccharine lines including, "You're okay <person>Mr. Man</person>," and "Go play with the live girls." I am not making this up. In fact, I don't think I am not even capable of making up such drivel.
The show is filled with mini-dramas. One has <person>Esther</person> planning to go to court to get custody of <person>Rachel</person> since her Dad is flipping out. Another has <person>Rachel</person> getting drunk and throwing up on her father. As I said earlier, only the comedy works.
There is one exception. <person>Paul</person> constantly and overtly flirts with seductive, but underage <person>Cindy</person>. This subplot appears to be nothing more substantial than the comedy about sandcastles, but in one intelligently written scene, the flirting reaches a surprising conclusion. This is quite an insightful scene, and one that I had not expected to see in such a trivial picture. Most impressive is that once it starts, it builds to an unexpected ending.
<person>Reliable James Horner</person> comes through with some excellent music. It has all of the genuine romantic and dreamy aspects that the picture itself lacks. Similarly, <person>Tim Suhrstedt</person>'s cinematography has a wonderful and beautiful surreal feel. The best scenes are the nighttime ones of luminescent blues.
GHOST is a much better picture that covers the same ground. I am at a loss to explain why <person>GILLIAN</person> was made. Is the availability of good looking leads suffice motivation to make a film?
TO <person>GILLIAN</person> ON HER 37TH BIRTHDAY runs just 1:33. It is now rated PG-13, but reportedly they made last minute adjustments to get an R rating removed. There is no sex, nudity, or violence. <person>Gillian</person>'s death is not shown, just the fall. The show includes a meaningless scene where <person>David</person> uses the F word several time and argues about the number of times he has used it. The picture would have been stronger without the scene and would have allowed younger kids to see it. Even so, my guess is that the show would be fine for most kids over say nine. You can make the decision knowing the F words are there. I laughed a lot, but was put off by the pseudo-serious parts so I can't quite bring myself to recommend it. I give it **.
**** = One of the top few films of this or any year. A must see film. *** = Excellent show. Look for it. ** = Average movie. Kind of enjoyable. * = Poor show. Don't waste your money. 0 = One of the worst films of this or any year. <person>Totally</person> unbearable.
