"Today it's Wheaties boxes," promises the promoter, <person>Don Tibbles</person> (<person>Michael Tucker</person>), to our young heroes. "Tomorrow it's video games and action figures. The sky's the limit!" <person>Riches</person> would soon be theirs (and <person>Disney</person>'s too).
In 1992 <person>Disney</person> grossed fifty million dollars with THE MIGHTY DUCKS, the story of a kids' hockey team of losers who go on to win the big championship. In 1994, <person>Disney</person> had no fresh ideas, but they figured they could cast the same actors and make as much money in a sequel. They were right.
In the sequel, D2: THE MIGHTY DUCKS, <person>Gordan Bombay</person> (<person>Emilio Estevez</person>) has been injured in the minor leagues so he has to go back to coaching. He is asked to coach <person>Team U.S.A .</person> in the Junior Goodwill Games in Los Angeles. Although logic would dictate that he recruit the best players from across the country, instead he takes the old <person>Mighty Duck s</person> and adds an ethnic and a geographic cross-section of the country. They range from a street tough ghetto kid to a rope throwing Texas cowboy. There is even a scene in the championship where the cowboy gets a penalty for roping a player on the ice. I am not making this up.
All movies need bad guys, and this time they choose Iceland to find the villains. Dressed all in black, the Icelanders sneer at <person>Team U.S.A .</person> The Icelandic coach, <person>Wolf Stanton</person> (<person>Carsten Norgaard</person>), has dramatically slicked-back, oily hair. <person>Coach Stanton</person> played one season in the pros where he earned the moniker "The Dentist" for setting a record on the number of his opponent's teeth that he broke. Yes sirree, this is one bad dude. He even tries to break <person>Coach Bombay</person>'s knee cap in a one-on-one challenge match with him. You do not even need to watch the screen to know when The Dentist is there, the music (<person>Steven Brill</person>) always moves into the deep registers when he is present.
Although beaten once by the Icelandic team, our heroes face them again in the finals. Make a guess how close the last game will be. Go ahead, take a really big risk and guess who will win.
All of the standard sports movie cliches are used and reused in the film. Easily the most ridiculous scene has Russ Tyler (<person>Kenan Thompson</person>), a member of the Goodwill Games's audience, challenge <person>Team U.S.A .</person> to leave practice and come to the ghetto to play street hockey. This event becomes the catharsis for rejuvenating <person>Team U.S.A .</person>
Still, when all is said and done, the show does have high energy even if few ideas. This is probably enough to satisfy The <person>Mighty Duck s</person>'s fans.
D2: THE MIGHTY DUCKS runs 1:47. It is rated PG for reasons that escape me. The film is fine for all ages. My son <person>Jeffrey</person>, age 8, thinks the movie is "terrific," and it is his favorite of the three <person>Mighty Duck</person> movies. I find the movie unimaginative and uninteresting so I do not recommend it. I give it * 1/2.
**** = A must see film. *** = Excellent show. Look for it. ** = Average movie. Kind of enjoyable. * = Poor show. Don't waste your money. 0 = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.
