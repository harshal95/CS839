The second and last picture to have <person>Timothy Dalton</person> as a cold as ice <person>James  Bond</person> is 1989's LICENCE TO KILL. If you like your 007s as dry as a dry martini, this may be the <person>Bond</person> for you. Otherwise, you may feel <person>Dalton</person> belongs with <person>George Lazenby</person> (ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE) as one of the actors who disgraced the <person>Bond</person> name.
LICENCE TO KILL features <person>Robert Davi</person> as a drug smuggler named <person>Franz Sanchez</person>, a sadomasochist who likes to whip his women when they don't obey. <person>Sanchez</person>'s band of drug runners use maggots to camouflage their stash and sharks to munch on any drug enforcement officers who get too close. CIA agent <person>Felix Leiter</person> (<person>David Hedison</person>) reappears from 1973's LIVE AND LET DIE, and promptly gets severely munched. <person>Bond</person>, who wants to go after the mutilators of his old friend <person>Leiter</person>, gets his "licence to kill" revoked by M when he refuses to give up the hunt.
Although set on <person>Key West</person> and on a Caribbean island, the cinematography by <person>Alec Mills</person> and the sets by <person>Peter Lamont</person> have none of the usual lovely travelogue aspect of <person>Bond</person> pictures. The mundane visuals fit right in with the bland storyline.
Where are the signature chase scenes, the sexual humor and the romantic trysts that we come to <person>Bond</person> films for in the first place? Here the chase scenes are mainly saved until the end.
In the perfect <person>Bond</person> setup, he runs out of gas in a speedboat on a romantic evening with a beautiful woman, <person>Pam  Bouvier</person> (<person>Carey Lowell</person>). <person>Dalton</person>'s reaction? He is miffed about the delay. Although his <person>Bond</person> finally agrees to a sexual encounter with her, it is only because she pressures him. The old <person>James</person> sought out such opportunities without being coerced. The only genuinely erotic scene occurs later when <person>Bond</person> sticks his hand up <person>Pam</person>'s skirt, but he's just going for her hidden gun. <person>Dalton</person> is dead serious, having little time to waste on women or humor.
(LICENCE TO KILL is the first <person>Bond</person> film to be rated PG-13 - they since have all had this rating - which is partly because of the addition in the early 1980s of the PG-13 rating and partly because of the increased amount of blood and profanity in LICENCE TO KILL.)
A white-suited <person>Wayne Newton</person>, providing some much needed humor, appears in a cameo as a televangelist on the prowl for donations. His real purpose is to convey the wholesale price of drugs and negotiate drug deals on the air in secret.
After a languid and completely formulaic movie, the pace finally picks up at the end in a long chase scene using large gasoline trucks. When the only memorable visual is a semi doing a wheelie, you know the picture is in trouble.
LICENCE TO KILL runs too long at 2:13. It is rated PG-13 for profanity and violence and would be fine for kids around 9 and up.
My son <person>Jeffrey</person>, age 9, thought the movie was just okay. He gave it ** and complained that it was too bloody.
